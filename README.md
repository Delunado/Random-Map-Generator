# Random-Map-Generator
It's an easy random map generator, working in the console. It generates a random "dungeon" map, where you choose the number of rooms, the map size and the start coords.

It have some errors, but it was just a simple experiment with some new OOP knowledges.

It's not compiled so if you want to try it you have to compile it. Sorry!
